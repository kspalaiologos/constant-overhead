# constant-overhead

A project aimed at measuring the constant overhead of various programming languages and their individual runtimes.

## Do we have a problem?

Many of the programming language benchmarks are generally not very representative:
- Task implementations usually vary wildly from language to language because programmers of lower level languages find hacks to make their code faster.
- The tasks necessitate the use of data structures and their implementations vary from platform to platform (e.g. Java's HashMap, C++'s unordered_map and Rust's HashMap have diverging design goals in a couple of places).
- They compare languages and not particular implementations.
- We don't know much about their testing rig.
- All the 'X beating C' proofs are egregious.
- ...

But there is a fundamental reason for why you'd want to compare runtimes and let this influence your language choice: boxing is not free, many runtimes can't reliably strip it off; some runtimes, particularly for dynamic languages, can not perform type inference well enough to lower FP operations to integer operations.

## Is there a solution?

This benchmark aims at testing something else: we wish to determine the *constant overhead* of a programming language. Of course, the time taken by the algorithm will grow proportionally to the input size, but from a programming standpoint, solutions that have too high constant factor (e.g. compare a program that takes 20n steps vs a program that takes 2n steps for an input of size n) are sometimes not feasible. The methodology is rather simple: take an uncomplicated algorithm which can not be improved too much using standard tricks (autovectorisation, loop unrolling) and translate it to each of the languages, applying performance tweaks (like defining types, turning off the GC, localising data) if they are feasible.

This benchmark will single out runtimes that behave badly in tight (yet very uncomplicated) loops, can't use the typing information well or infer it in the runtime, don't offer rudimentary performance improvement techniques (e.g. integer division), can't inline code efficiently, don't optimise arithmetic, use an inefficient numerical tower, and incur unavoidable penalties in array accesses.

To make this benchmark fair for runtimes that take an excessively long amount of time in warmup, we will use small and large workloads designed to amortise this. Memory usage is not measured. Only publicly available, free runtimes are tested.

FPAQ0, the test program, is a very simple order-0 statistical model coupled together with a bitwise arithmetic coder due to Matt Mahoney. We slightly simplify it and use it as a benchmark. Among data compression experts, FPAQ0 and variants are used for benchmarking particular bitwise arithmetic coding strategies.

# Benchmarks

Notes on the benchmark results below:
- PUC-RIO Lua/CPython were not tested, because they are not worth testing.
- LuaJIT lacks a way to issue `idiv` and likely pays for it, but according to `luajit -lp` most of the time is spent in the arithmetic coder anyway.
- WASI-SDK clang's standard library might use (too) small I/O buffers, worsening its performance.
- In line with the C implementation, try to not use object-oriented programming: in metatable/prototype-oriented languages, looking up a method in an object is somewhat costly. The code does, however, use any feature of the language feasible to represent the arithmetic encoder state structure that can be passed around. This often amounts to having a class with just a constructor and a few public fields.
- Numba: Seems to be missing a lot of opcode implementations, dunno how to make it work. Cython also does not seem to help much.
- Temurin JDK was not tested as it does not significantly affect the performance.

Interesting findings:
- Turn-the-GC-off snake oil doesn't work (e.g. through enabling EpsilonGC for Java). For major runtimes this makes no difference because the program does not allocate enough to warrant a GC cycle. This is at least a bit surprising, because in programmer folklore, GC is always responsible for all the plagues of the world.
